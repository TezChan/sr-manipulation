\b mini_master_controller contains an implementation of a Master Controller to reproduce the behaviour of the sr_gui_manipulation package. The Master Controller contains an actionlib server that is triggered by another node (normally a GUI) and starts the execution of the steps by sending goals to every individual step's actionlib server.
